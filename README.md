Hey there, welcome to FlavorMatch - where your taste buds meet their match!

## Introduction
FlavorMatch is a fun project I wanted to make! It's like Tinder, but for finding your next delicious dish. Whether you're a kitchen pro or just starting out, FlavorMatch helps you discover yummy recipes based on what you love.

## Features
- **Discover Yummy Dishes:** It's as easy as pressing the heart for a recipe you love, the X for one that's not your taste.
- **Filter Ingredients:** Got random stuff in your pantry you want to use? No worries! Use FlavorMatch's filter system and find recipes you can make with what you've got.
- **Save Your Faves:** Found a recipe you adore? Save it to your favorites so you can cook it again and again.

## Getting Started
Ready to dive into FlavorMatch? Awesome! Just fire up the app, create your profile (don't worry, we won't judge your love for cheese), and start clicking!

## WIP
Work in Progress. My idea with this is to at some point in the future port the frontend to Angular. Maybe even as an app at some point, who knows.
