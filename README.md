# FlavorMatch

Hey there, welcome to FlavorMatch - where your taste buds meet their match!

## Introduction
FlavorMatch is a fun project I wanted to make! It's like Tinder, but for finding your next delicious dish. Whether you're a kitchen pro or just starting out, FlavorMatch helps you discover yummy recipes based on what you love.

## Features
- **Swipe through Yummy Dishes:** It's as easy as swiping right for a recipe you love, left for one that's not your taste.
- **Filter Ingredients:** Got random stuff in your pantry? No worries! Let FlavorMatch spin the wheel and find recipes you can make with what you've got.
- **Save Your Faves:** Found a recipe you adore? Save it to your favorites so you can cook it again and again.

## Getting Started
Ready to dive into FlavorMatch? Awesome! Just fire up the app, create your profile (don't worry, we won't judge your love for cheese), and start swiping!

## Feedback
Got ideas to make FlavorMatch even more awesome? Spotted a bug? We want to hear it all! Shoot me a message at contact@sebh.dk and let's chat.

## WIP
This project is VERY fresh.
